## Welcome to Saren's Secret Hideout

For past however long I have worked in Digital Marketing. I started out in the mid-90s learning HTML on my roommates computer while she went to work at suck.com.

I'm still learning, this time on GitHub pages, so that I can promote myself, and my skills, in order to join a DAO.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/13ager/13ager.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
